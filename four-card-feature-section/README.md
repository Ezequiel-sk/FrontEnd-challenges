## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- SCSS
  - Variables
  - Partials
- Media Queries

### What I Learned

While working on this front-end challenge, I didn't encounter completely new concepts; nevertheless, it was my first experience designing a full page layout instead of individual cards. This challenge allowed me to reinforce my understanding of Flexbox in CSS, which I had previously learned from other projects.

### Continued Development

I intend to continue tackling front-end challenges to further refine my knowledge in this area and consistently practice my programming skills.
