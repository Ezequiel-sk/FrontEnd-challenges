### What I learned
By completing this challenge, I reinforced my knowledge of the technologies I used. Also, I learned how to add descriptions meta tag to web pages for SEO purposes. 

Here is the code snippet:

```html
  <head>
    <meta name="description" content="Frontend Mentor Profile card component challenge completed by Ezequiel-Sk">
    <!-- .... -->
  </head>
```

> It's always essential to provide meta descriptions for web pages to improve search engine rankings and help users understand what the page is about.
