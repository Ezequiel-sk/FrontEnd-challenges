## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- SCSS (Sass)
  - Variables
  - Partials
  - browser reset
- Media Queries

### What I learned

In this challenge, despite its greater complexity compared to the previous ones, I did not acquire new knowledge. However, I managed to consolidate my skills and hone my understanding of element placement using properties like `position: absolute;`, `position: fixed;` and `position: relative;`. 

Even so, I must admit that these properties have presented me with certain challenges during the execution of this project.

### Future Improvements

Going ahead with the **JUNIOR** level challenges in the field of front-end development will allow me to strengthen my skills and further hone my capabilities in this area.
